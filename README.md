### Instruction 
The assignment requires to use Realm database, but I have some problem to setup Realm. It took me too much time for that, so that I changed to build a NodeJS server and connect to it. 

The server code is in `server` folder, please make sure you run it before try the code. NodeJS is required. Please install it before run it. 

- Change directory to the server folder
- Run `nodemon main.js`
- Run iOS code
